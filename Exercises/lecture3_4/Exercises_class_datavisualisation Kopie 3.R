#### 1.2 Aesthetic mappings

# Exercise 1
# Use the dataset health_data to create a scatterplot showing the relationship between child and maternal malnutrition and neonatal disorders. Color all points in red.
names(health_data)

ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders), color= "red")

# Exercise 2
# Recreate the same scatterplot, this time with the colors of the points indicating the continents.


ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders, color= continent))

#### 1.3 Facets

# Exercise 1
# Again create a scatterplot showing the relationship between child and maternal malnutrition and neonatal disorders. Facet the plot into three rows based on the continent.

ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 3)

# Exercise 2
# Recreate the same plot, this time showing all continents next to each other (one column per continent and only one row). Try to find two different options to create this plot.

#option 1)
ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1)

# option2)
ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders)) +
  facet_grid(.~ continent)

# Exercise 3
# Again recreate the scatterplot of child and maternal malnutrition and neonatal disorders. Facet the plot by continent and the disease or risk factor causing most deaths. Create one row for each continent and one column for each cause.
#row for each continent and column for each cause!

ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders)) +
  facet_grid(continent ~ top_cause)

# empty ones cause does not exist there!

#### 1.4 Geometric objects

# Exercise 1
# Again create a scatterplot showing the relationship between child and maternal malnutrition and neonatal disorders. Now add a second layer to the plot showing a smooth line fitted to the data and the corresponding confidence interval. Try to create this plot without introducing duplications in your code for the different layers.
# Note: We will get a message on which method is used to fit the line. We could adjust this method, but for now we will stick with the default.


ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders)) 
+ geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders))

# w/out duplications:

ggplot(data = health_data, mapping = aes(x=child_maternal_malnutrition, y=  neonatal_disorders)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# Exercise 2
# Recreate the same plot with the following two adaptations: 1) use the color of the points to indicate the continent and 2) subset the data shown in the fitted line to Asia.
ggplot(data = health_data, mapping = aes(x=child_maternal_malnutrition, y=  neonatal_disorders)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(data=subset(health_data, continent=="Asia"))

#### 1.5 Statistical transformations

# Exercise 1
# Create a bar plot that shows the numbers of countries in each continent in the dataset health_data. Try to find two different options to create this plot.

ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = continent))

ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = continent))

# Exercise 2
# Create a bar plot showing the shares of deaths from dementia in Sweden for all years from 2010 to 2017.

ggplot(data = subset(health_data_complete, country=="Sweden")) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year, y = dementia), stat = "identity")
# maybe better use geom-line and aleave out stat = identitiy then !
ggplot(data = subset(health_data_complete, country=="Sweden")) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = dementia))

# start y ais at 0.5!
ggplot(data = subset(health_data_complete, country=="Sweden")) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = dementia)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.05,0.15))

# compare countries!
ggplot(data = subset(health_data_complete, country%in%c("Sweden","Austria"))) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = dementia, color = country)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.05,0.15))

#### 1.6 Position adjustments

# Exercise 1
# Again create a bar plot that shows the numbers of countries in each continent in the dataset health_data. Fill the bars with colors indicating the disaese or risk factor causing most deaths.


ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = continent, color=top_cause))


ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = continent, fill=top_cause))

# use different colors! 
ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = continent, fill=top_cause)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
# Exercise 2
# Recreate the same plot. To improve the comparability of the proportions accross the groups, extend all bars to the same height


ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = continent, fill = top_cause), position = "fill")

#### 1.7 Coordinate systems

# Exercise 1
# Recreate the bar chart that shows the numbers of countries in each continent in the dataset health_data. Fill the bars with colors indicating the disaese of risk factor causing most deaths. In addition, flip the x and y axis of the plot.

ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = continent, fill = top_cause)) +
  coord_flip()

#### 1.9 Themes and labels

# Exercise 1
# Recreate the bar plot showing the shares of deaths from dementia in Sweden for all years from 2010 to 2017. This time, use a white instead of a gray background.

ggplot(data = subset(health_data_complete, country=="Sweden")) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year, y = dementia), stat = "identity")+
theme_bw()
# look up link for other theme!

# Exercise 2

ggplot(data = subset(health_data_complete, country=="Sweden")) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year, y = dementia), stat = "identity")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)


# Exercise 3
# Recreate the bar chart that shows the numbers of countries in each continent in the dataset health_data. Fill the bars with colors indicating the disaese or risk factor causing most deaths. In addition, make the plot more self-explanatory by adding a plot title and suitable legend and axis titles.


ggplot(data = health_data) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = continent, fill = top_cause)) +
             labs(title = "Number of countries by continent and leading cuase by death", x = "Continet", y = "Number of countries", fill = "Leading cause of death")

#### 2.3 Variation

# Exercise 1
# Create a histogram showing the distribution of the shares of deaths from dementia in 2017. Choose a suitable binwidth and let the labels of the x axis indicate that you are plotting shares.

ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = dementia), binwidth = 0.01) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

# Exercise 2

ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = dementia, color = continent), binwidth = 0.01) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)


#### 2.4 Missing values

# Exercise 1
# Run the following code to create a copy of the dataset health_data in which values larger than 14% are replaced by NAs in the column dementia.
health_data_1 = mutate(health_data, dementia = ifelse(dementia>0.14, NA, dementia))
# Now create a column called "missing" in health_data_1 that indicates whether dementia is NA. Next, create a bar chart that shows the numbers of countries per continent and indicates in which continents we have missing values for dementia.

### falsch 
health_data_1 = mutate(health_data_1, missing = is.na(dementia))
### falsch 
ggplot(data = health_data_1) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=continent, fill = missing))


#### 2.5 Covariation

# Exercise 1

ggplot(data = health_data) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(continent, dementia, FUN = median), y = dementia)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
# Exercise 2
# Use the hexbin package to plot the relationship between child and maternal malnutrition and neonatal disorders. Let the x and y axis labels show that you are plotting shares.

ggplot(data = health_data_complete) +
  geom_hex(mapping = aes(x = child_maternal_malnutrition, y = neonatal_disorders)) +   scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
